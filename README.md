# Structures-Templates-Articles

Here I have:
- Liferay Structures, 
- Liferay Templates (using HTML, CSS and Velocity Macro Script) and 
- Liferay page contents - setup to be displayed using above templates.


You can use Structures to define which fields are available to users when they create content. These can be coupled with Templates that define how to display that content. 

Liferay WCM makes it easy to create structures, templates, and content from the same interface.

Content can then be styled properly using CSS, because markup is generated consistently by the template when structured content is displayed. In essence, templates are scripts that tell Liferay how to display content in the structure. Without a template, the portal has no idea how to display content which has been created using a custom structure.


Content won’t get stale, because you can take advantage of the Scheduling feature to determine when content is displayed and when it’s removed. 

Additionally, you can configure Liferay’s built-in Workflow system to set up a review and publishing process so only what you want winds up on the live site. Liferay Portal gives you the management tools you need to run everything from a simple, one-page web site to an enormous, content-rich site.
